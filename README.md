Leroy, also known as Experiment 629, is a genetic experiment by Dr. Jumba Jookiba under the demands of Dr. Hämsterviel who appears in the direct-to-video film "Leroy & Stitch" and the manga "Stitch & the Samurai". Made from the Experiment 626 template, he is Stitch's evil twin. Shortly after his creation, he was cloned to become a massive army serving Hämsterviel. However, Jumba implanted a fail-safe in him during his creation; if he listens to the song "Aloha 'Oe", he will shut down.
